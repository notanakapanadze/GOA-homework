    <p>West's second and third studio albums, Late Registration (2005) and Graduation (2007), both debuted atop the
        Billboard 200, the latter becoming West's most commercially successful to date. Three of his subsequent albums,
        808s & Heartbreak (2008), My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010), and The Life of Pablo (2016), were certified
        triple platinum, and Yeezus (2013) was certified double platinum. While not as well-received critically as his
        previous efforts, Ye (2018), Jesus Is King (2019), and Donda (2021) continued West's series of consecutive
        number one debuts on the Billboard 200. West has also released the collaborative albums Watch the Throne (2011)
        with Jay-Z, Kids See Ghosts (2018) with Kid Cudi, and Vultures 1 and Vultures 2 (2024) with Ty Dolla Sign. In
        fashion design, he has collaborated with Nike, Inc., Louis Vuitton, and Gap Inc. on clothing and footwear, and
        led the Yeezy collaboration with Adidas.

        One of the world's best-selling music artists with 160 million records sold, West has won 24 Grammy Awards, the
        joint 11th-most of all time and most awarded for any hip hop artist along with Jay-Z. His other accolades
        include a Billboard Artist Achievement Award, a joint-record three Brit Awards for Best International Male Solo
        Artist, and the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award. West holds the joint record (with Bob Dylan) for most
        albums (4) topping the annual Pazz & Jop critic poll. Time named him one of the 100 most influential people in
        the world in 2005 and 2015. West's first six solo albums were included on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest
        Albums of All Time list in 2020, with the same publication naming him one of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All
        Time.</p>

    <p>Kanye West, an influential figure in contemporary music and fashion, is not only known for his artistic achievements but also for the intricacies of his personal life. Born on June 8, 1977, in Atlanta, Georgia, and raised in Chicago, Illinois, Kanye's upbringing played a significant role in shaping his personality and career. His parents divorced when he was young, which had a profound impact on his life and artistry. His mother, Donda West, was a significant influence, nurturing his creativity and providing support throughout his early endeavors.

        West's career began in the early 2000s, transitioning from a producer for artists like Jay-Z to a solo artist. His debut album, The College Dropout, released in 2004, was a critical and commercial success, showcasing his unique style and lyrical depth. However, alongside his professional triumphs, Kanye's personal life has been marked by numerous controversies and challenges.
        
        Kanye’s relationships have often made headlines, particularly his high-profile marriage to reality television star Kim Kardashian. The couple married in 2014 and had four children together: North, Saint, Chicago, and Psalm. Their relationship was a blend of fame and controversy, frequently highlighted in the media. Despite their initial portrayal as a power couple, their marriage faced significant strains, culminating in their divorce in early 2021. The couple's co-parenting dynamic, along with Kanye's public comments and behavior during their separation, drew considerable media scrutiny.
        
        In addition to his relationships, Kanye has been open about his struggles with mental health, publicly revealing his bipolar disorder diagnosis in 2018. His candidness regarding mental health issues has sparked important conversations about the stigma surrounding mental illness, particularly within the entertainment industry. However, his erratic behavior, including controversial statements and social media outbursts, has also raised concerns about his well-being and the impact of fame on his mental health.
        
        Kanye’s forays into the fashion world further illustrate the complexities of his personal life. He founded the Yeezy brand, which gained immense popularity, particularly the Yeezy sneaker line in collaboration with Adidas. This venture not only showcased his creative talents but also brought about discussions on consumer culture, race, and class in the fashion industry.
        
        Throughout his life, Kanye West has remained a polarizing figure. His innovative contributions to music and fashion are often overshadowed by controversies surrounding his personal life and public persona. However, his influence is undeniable, as he has pushed the boundaries of creativity and expression, challenging societal norms and expectations. Kanye’s journey reflects the intricate relationship between personal struggles, artistic expression, and the burdens of fame, making him a complex character in the landscape of modern culture.
        
        In conclusion, Kanye West's personal life is a tapestry of triumphs, tribulations, and transformation. From his upbringing and relationships to his mental health struggles and fashion ventures, Kanye embodies the complexities of a modern icon. His story serves as a reminder of the human experience behind the fame, highlighting the challenges and realities faced by individuals in the public eye.</p>
