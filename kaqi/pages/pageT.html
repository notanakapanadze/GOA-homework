    <p>Tyler Gregory Okonma (born March 6, 1991), known professionally as Tyler, the Creator, is an American rapper,
        record producer, director, and fashion designer. He has been cited as an influential figure in alternative hip
        hop during the 2010s.

        Okonma became well known in the late 2000s, when he emerged on the internet as the leader and co-founder of the
        music collective Odd Future. Within the group, Okonma participated as a rapper, producer, director and actor,
        releasing studio albums that he produced for its respective members. Okonma also performed on his sketch comedy
        show Loiter Squad (2012-2014).

        Along with his collaborations with the group, Okonma developed his solo career beginning with his self-released
        debut mixtape Bastard (2009). Bastard earned him recognition in the online music press as an emerging artist
        from the indie music scene. His debut studio album, Goblin (2011), brought him mainstream media exposure, aided
        by the popularity of the single "Yonkers" and its accompanying music video. During this period, Okonma faced
        controversy in the media for his horrorcore-influenced sound and his violent, transgressive lyrical content.

        After the release of his second studio album, Wolf (2013), Okonma began to separate himself from his horrorcore
        productions, turning to more accessible sounds including fusions of jazz, soul and R&B. In 2017, Okonma released
        Flower Boy, followed by subsequent albums Igor (2019) and Call Me If You Get Lost (2021), all of which earned
        him widespread critical acclaim and commercial success, with the latter two albums debuting at number one on the
        Billboard 200 and each winning Best Rap Album at the 2020 and 2022 Grammy Awards, respectively. His seventh
        studio album Chromakopia was released on October 28, 2024.</p>

    <p>Tyler, the Creator's music is known for its bold lyrics, inventive production, and genre-blending style. He first
        gained attention with dark, gritty songs like "Yonkers" from his album Goblin (2011), showcasing his rebellious
        style and unique voice. His third album, Wolf (2013), introduced a softer side, with tracks like "Awkward" and
        "IFHY" focusing on personal and emotional themes.

        With Flower Boy (2017), Tyler earned widespread acclaim, showing more vulnerability and growth in songs like
        "See You Again" and "Boredom", which combined hip-hop, soul, and jazz influences. The album addressed themes of
        loneliness, love, and self-discovery, marking a turning point in his sound.

        In IGOR (2019), he embraced a more experimental, synth-heavy sound. Songs like "EARFQUAKE" and "A BOY IS A GUN"
        tell a story of love and heartbreak, blending R&B, pop, and hip-hop elements. His latest album, Call Me If You
        Get Lost (2021), revisits classic hip-hop styles with hits like "WUSYANAME" and "LUMBERJACK", and explores
        themes of freedom, travel, and confidence.

        Tyler's songs reflect his artistic evolution, tackling complex emotions and blending genres, making him a unique
        and influential figure in modern music.</p>
