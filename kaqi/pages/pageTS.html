    <p>Jacques Bermon Webster II (born April 30, 1991), known professionally as Travis Scott (formerly stylized as
        Travi$ Scott), is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, and record producer. Scott has had four number-one
        hits on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart, along with a total of over one hundred charting songs. In addition to
        ten Grammy Award nominations, he has won a Latin Grammy Award, Billboard Music Award, MTV Video Music Award, and
        several BET Hip Hop Awards.[9] Scott's musical style has been described as a "blend between traditional hip-hop
        and lo-fi" and often characterized as "ambient," with a heavily appraised influence from rappers Kanye West and
        Kid Cudi. His stage name is derived from the latter's real name, Scott Mescudi, combined with the name of a
        favorite uncle.

        In 2012, Scott signed his first major-label recording contract with Epic Records, as well as a publishing deal
        with Kanye West's GOOD Music as an in-house producer. In April 2013, he entered a joint-venture record deal with
        Georgia-based rapper T.I.'s Grand Hustle Records. Scott self-released his first full-length project, a mixtape
        titled Owl Pharaoh in 2013, which was followed by his debut mixtape, Days Before Rodeo (2014). His debut studio
        album, Rodeo (2015), was met with critical and commercial success; it spawned the singles "3500" (featuring
        Future and 2 Chainz) and "Antidote," the latter peaked at number 16 on the Billboard Hot 100. His second album,
        Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight (2016), became his first number-one album on the Billboard 200 chart. In the
        following year, Scott formed the duo Huncho Jack with rapper Quavo, with whom he released an eponymous
        collaborative album (2017).

        Scott's third studio album, Astroworld (2018), was released to widespread critical acclaim and became his second
        consecutive number-one album on the Billboard 200. It yielded his first Billboard Hot 100 number-one single,
        "Sicko Mode" (featuring Drake).[10] In late 2019, Scott's vanity label imprint, Cactus Jack Records released the
        compilation album JackBoys, which also topped the Billboard 200. With his 2019 single "Highest in the Room" and
        his 2020 singles "The Scotts" (with Kid Cudi) and "Franchise" (featuring Young Thug and M.I.A.), Scott became
        the first artist on the Billboard Hot 100 to have three songs debut at number one in less than a year. Following
        a series of controversies and five years after the release of his previous solo album, Scott released Utopia
        (2023), which became his fourth consecutive number-one album on the Billboard 200.</p>

    <p>Travis Scott, born Jacques Berman Webster II on April 30, 1991, in Houston, Texas, has had a dynamic personal life that has often been in the spotlight. Growing up in Missouri City, a suburb of Houston, he lived with his grandmother in a lower-income area until he moved to a more affluent neighborhood with his parents during his teenage years. His mother worked for Apple, and his father ran a business and was also a musician, which influenced Travis’s early interest in music.

        Scott's high-profile relationship with Kylie Jenner, a media personality and entrepreneur, has been a significant aspect of his personal life. The couple began dating in 2017 and welcomed their daughter, Stormi Webster, in February 2018. Although they’ve had an on-and-off relationship, they welcomed a second child, a son, in February 2022. Despite public speculation about their relationship status, both have expressed dedication to co-parenting.
        
        Travis has also faced challenges and controversies, especially surrounding the 2021 Astroworld Festival tragedy, where crowd surges led to the deaths of several fans. This incident brought heightened public scrutiny, affecting both his personal and professional life. In response, Travis has been involved in philanthropic efforts, especially in his hometown, such as donations to arts and educational initiatives.
        
        Despite controversies, Travis Scott has managed to stay a prominent figure in both the music industry and popular culture, with a personal life that remains closely followed by fans and the media alike.</p>

    <p>Travis Scott is known for his high-energy, atmospheric songs that blend rap with elements of trap, psychedelia,
        and auto-tuned vocals. His breakout song "Antidote" from Rodeo (2015) introduced his signature dark, moody sound
        and quickly became a hit. Other standout tracks from Rodeo, like "3500" and "Maria I'm Drunk," showcased his
        talent for collaboration with artists like Future and Justin Bieber.

        With Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight (2016), Travis delivered songs like "Goosebumps" and "Pick Up the Phone,"
        which feature catchy hooks and heavy beats, becoming crowd favorites. His 2018 album Astroworld took his music
        to a new level with hits like "Sicko Mode," a multi-part anthem with Drake that dominated charts, and
        "Stargazing," which set the tone for the album's spacey, festival-ready vibe.

        In 2020, his song "THE SCOTTS," a collaboration with Kid Cudi, debuted during his in-game concert in Fortnite,
        showcasing his influence on pop culture. Tracks from Utopia (2023), such as "Meltdown" with Drake and "K-POP"
        with Bad Bunny and The Weeknd, show his continued experimentation with new sounds and international
        collaborations. Travis's music is known for its immersive production, hypnotic beats, and massive appeal in the
        hip-hop and festival scenes.</p>
