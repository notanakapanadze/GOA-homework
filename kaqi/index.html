    <h2>Generall information about rap</h2>
    <p><Strong>Rap music</Strong> is a genre of music that combines rhythm, rhyming speech, and beats. Originating in
        the <em>1970s</em> in the <em>Bronx, New York City</em>, it grew out of hip-hop culture and has roots in African
        American, Caribbean, and Latino communities. In rap, artists <i>(called rappers or MCs)</i> deliver lyrics in a
        rhythmic, spoken form, often addressing <em>personal stories, social issues, or community life</em>. Known for
        its beats
        and bass, rap often features DJing and sampling, where parts of other songs are remixed into new tracks. Over
        time, rap has grown globally, influencing many cultures and evolving into various sub-genres like trap, drill,
        and conscious rap.</p>
